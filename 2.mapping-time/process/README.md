## The orientation, size and hue of the balls determines the flow of time.
## The 2 long bars represent smaller scales of time while the 2 short ones move along the x-axis displaying a "bigger" scale.
## The arcs follow the circumference, when it becomes a circle it means a cycle has passed and it restarts. Each arc represents a different value.
